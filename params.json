It's useful for web applications with static relational data, allowing you to import JSON data, create collections of objects, define relations between them, and easily traverse the relationship graph from your application code. **Relate** is lightweight, dependency-free and framework-agnostic, easily compatible with applications built with Angular, React and more.\r\n\r\nNote that while objects and their relationships can be modified, **Relate** works best with a predefined dataset that doesn't change during an application's runtime. If your application involves changing data, consider a more robust relational framework such as [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) paired with [Backbone-relational](http://backbonerelational.org).\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nNone! :tada:\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nInstall manually: just copy `dist/relate.min.js` wherever you'd like.\r\n\r\nInstall using Bower:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbower install --save relate\r\n```\r\n\r\nLoad in a browser:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script src=\"relate.min.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nLoad using Node.js\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar Relate = require('Relate');\r\n```\r\n\r\nLoad using AMD:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nrequire(['Relate'], function (Relate) {\r\n  // ...\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n* [Getting Started](https://github.com/jakelazaroff/relate/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)\r\n* [API Documentation](https://github.com/jakelazaroff/relate/blob/master/docs/api-documentation.md)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
